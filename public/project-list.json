            "Featured at the Human-Computer Interactions International conference (HCII) in 2024, this web-application served as a proof-of-concept to show how vigourous AI research could be applied to empower social media users to safeguard themselves from any fraudulent accounts that may be targeting them. The UI was inspired by ScamAdviser, and enables users to receive real-time, data-driven advice with the click of a button. Unfortunately, the application is no longer operational due to unmanageable costs associated with third-party API access.",

Word Burglar reverses the roles of the human and the computer, allowing the users to provide clues while a greedy heuristic algorithm guesses the word.

That winter, FileDrop was born, enabling students and others to trade security for convenience when it suits them best, and seemlessly access files on the cloud without the hassel of MFA.",
